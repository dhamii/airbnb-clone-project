## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

The database schema is designed for efficiency, scalability, and clear relationships between users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.

### Key Entities

| Entity | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **User** | Represents both hosts and guests. Contains authentication details, contact info, and profile data. |
| **Property** | Stores information about listed properties including title, description, price, location, amenities, and availability. |
| **Booking** | Tracks reservations made by users for specific properties, including check-in/check-out dates and status. |
| **Payment** | Records payment details related to bookings, including amount, status, and transaction reference. |
| **Review** | Stores user feedback and ratings for properties after completed bookings. |

### Example Relationships

- A **User** can list multiple **Properties**.  
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.  
- A **Payment** is associated with one **Booking**.  
- A **Review** references both a **User** and a **Property**.
