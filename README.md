## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

The database schema is designed for efficiency, scalability, and clear relationships between users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.

### Key Entities

| Entity | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **User** | Represents both hosts and guests. Contains authentication details, contact info, and profile data. |
| **Property** | Stores information about listed properties including title, description, price, location, amenities, and availability. |
| **Booking** | Tracks reservations made by users for specific properties, including check-in/check-out dates and status. |
| **Payment** | Records payment details related to bookings, including amount, status, and transaction reference. |
| **Review** | Stores user feedback and ratings for properties after completed bookings. |

### Example Relationships

- A **User** can list multiple **Properties**.  
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings**.  
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.  
- A **Payment** is associated with one **Booking**.  
- A **Review** references both a **User** and a **Property**.

## üõ°Ô∏è API Security

Security is a critical aspect of this project to ensure that user data, financial transactions, and API interactions are well-protected. The following measures will be implemented:

### 1. **Authentication**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used to securely verify user identities and manage sessionless authentication.
- **Token Expiry:** Tokens are configured with limited lifetimes to reduce risk if compromised.
- **Refresh Tokens:** Allow users to maintain sessions securely without exposing sensitive credentials.

### 2. **Authorization**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Different roles (Admin, Host, Guest) have specific permissions.
- **Object-Level Permissions:** Users can only access or modify resources they own (e.g., a host can only manage their own properties).

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
- Prevents brute-force attacks and API abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single IP within a specific timeframe.
- Implemented using Django REST Framework‚Äôs built-in throttling or third-party middleware.

### 4. **Data Validation & Sanitization**
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.
- Strict schema validation on both REST and GraphQL endpoints.

### 5. **HTTPS Enforcement**
- All communications between client and server will be encrypted using HTTPS to protect data in transit.

### 6. **Secure Storage**
- Sensitive information (e.g., passwords, payment tokens) is encrypted using industry-standard hashing algorithms like **PBKDF2** or **bcrypt**.
- Environment variables are used for secret keys and database credentials.

### 7. **CORS Policy**
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to allow access only from trusted domains.

### 8. **Logging & Monitoring**
- Authentication attempts, failed logins, and security-related events are logged for auditing.
- Continuous monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry) will be used to detect and respond to anomalies in real time.

---

These measures collectively ensure that the backend API remains **secure, reliable, and compliant** with modern web security standards.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** is a development practice that automates the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying them to production.  
This ensures that new features, fixes, and updates are delivered **quickly**, **reliably**, and **safely** without manual intervention.

### Why It‚Äôs Important for This Project
- **Automation:** Reduces human errors by automating testing, building, and deployment steps.
- **Faster Delivery:** Enables rapid release of new features and bug fixes.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that every deployment follows the same reliable process.
- **Early Detection:** Continuous testing helps identify bugs or issues early in the development cycle.
- **Scalability:** Supports smooth scaling and version control as the project grows.

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions:** For automating build, test, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.  
- **Docker:** Ensures a consistent environment across development, testing, and production.  
- **Docker Compose:** Simplifies managing multi-container applications during deployment.  
- **Render / AWS / DigitalOcean:** (Optional) Used for hosting and automatic deployment after successful CI checks.  
- **pytest / Django Test Framework:** For automated testing to ensure code stability before merging.
